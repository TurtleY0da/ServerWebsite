                <em>Griefing includes mass TNT explosions, lava casts, covering stuff in lava or water, and any form of

            <li>
                Illegal Killing:<br>
                <em>Illegal killing includes repeated killing, spawn killing, unsolicited killing, revenge killing, and
                    killing that results in the destruction of the person's items (by lava, void, etc.) unless they gave
                    you permission or you help recover lost items.

                    <br>
                    This does not include prank kills (administrators get to determine whether a prank kill was illegal
                    or not), war, if both parties agree to fight, or a trap in your own base/territory.</em>

        <h3>Admins decide if a rule was broken. They can ban and give warnings as they see fit, even if a rule listed here was not explicitly broken. However, Admin abuse is also not tolerated, and will result in the banning of the Admin.</h3>
